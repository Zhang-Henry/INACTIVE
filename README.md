# IMPERATIVE - Towards Imperceptible Backdoor Attack in Self-supervised Learning
This repository contains the code of the paper "[Towards Imperceptible Backdoor Attack in Self-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14672)", an imperceptible and effective backdoor attack against self-supervised models. 
<!-- Here is an overview of our IMPERATIVE:

## Required python packages

Our code is tested under the following environment: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, Ubuntu 22.04, cuda 11.8, Python 3.8.5, torch 2.0.1, torchvision 0.15.2, numpy 1.23.4, pandas 2.0.3, pillow 10.1.0, and tqdm 4.65.0.

## Pretraining image encoders

The file pretraining_encoder.py is used to pre-train an image encoder.

To pre-train an image encoder on CIFAR10 or STL10, you could first download the data from the following link [data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1acJr1fP2paK6pNq2bL6lzPTccv6nSzX6?usp=sharing) (put the data folder under IMPERATIVE). Then, you could run the following script to pre-train image encoders on CIFAR10 and STL10:

```
python3 scripts/run_pretraining_encoder.py
```
It may take up more than 10 hours and 15G to pretrain the encoder on a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090. You can also download pre-trained image encoders on CIFAR10 or STL10 from the following link [data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1acJr1fP2paK6pNq2bL6lzPTccv6nSzX6?usp=sharing) and put them under output folder.
## Pretraining backdoor injectors

The file optimize_filter/run_pretrain.sh is a script used to pre-train a backdoor encoder.

You could run the following script in the optimize_filter directory to pre-train a backdoor encoder on CIFAR10 and STL10:

```
python3 scripts/run_pretrain.sh
```
It may take up more than 5 hours and 10G to pretrain the backdoor injectors on a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090.
## IMPERATIVE

The file imperative.py implements our IMPERATIVE.

You can use the following example script to optimize a imperative backdoor trigger and embed it to an image encoder, where the shadow dataset is CIFAR10 and the reference inputs are images of a truck, digit one, and priority traffic sign:

```
python3 scripts/run_imperative.py
```
It may take up more than 10 hours and 10G to pretrain the backdoor injectors on a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090.
## Training downstream classifiers

The file training\_downstream\_classifier.py can be used to train a downstream classifier on a downstream task using an image encoder. Here are some example scripts:

```
python3 scripts/run_cifar10_training_downstream_classifier.py
python3 scripts/run_imagenet_training_downstream_classifier.py
```

It may take up more than 1 hours and 1G to pretrain the backdoor injectors on a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090.
